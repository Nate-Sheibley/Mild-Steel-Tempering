# Presentation Reqs
## Clear Objective and Purpose
1. Goal-Oriented: Start with a clear understanding of the purpose of your presentation. What are you trying to convey? Is it to inform, persuade, or explore
data? Define your key message or insight.
2. Target Audience: Tailor your visualizations and explanations to the knowledge level and interests of your audience. Consider what they need to know and
how best to communicate that information to them.
## Relevant and Accurate Data
1. Relevant Data: for example, if your story is about hourly changes in rainfall, your visualization data shouldnâ€™t be in months.
2. Contextualization: if warranted, provide context for the data. Explain where it comes from, the time period it covers, and any assumptions or limitations.
## Effective Visual Design
1. Choosing the Right Chart Type: Use appropriate visualizations (bar charts, line graphs, scatter plots, etc.) that best represent the data and the insights you
want to convey.
2. Simplicity: Avoid clutter and unnecessary details. Strive for simplicity in design while ensuring all necessary information is included.
3. Consistency: Maintain consistent use of colors, fonts, and design elements throughout the presentation to avoid confusion and enhance readability.
4. Accessibility [OPTIONAL]: Ensure that the design is accessible to all viewers, including those with color blindness or other visual impairments. Use color
palettes that are colorblind-friendly and provide sufficient contrast.

## Script Notes
1. I'm going to be talking the tempering of steel today. I'll need to provide some background on why this is important. I'm sure we've all bent a piece of metal back and forth until it breaks. Bending it, putting it through roller to thin  a sheet, drawing it through dies to stretch a bar into wire, and heating are called "working" a metal. All metal working causes different stresses to accumulate in  the metal, and results in work hardening. Eventually resulting in irrepairable cracking.

2. So, for example, we're halfway through bending a tube of steel into a chair, a fairly conplex shape. But we have work hardened it thoroughly in the process, making it stiff and brittle. Annleaing the steel, by heating it to a few hundred degrees Celcius in a controlled manner can help relieve the stresses caused by work hardening, so that more work can be done without irrepairable cracking. Tempering is an almost identical process, but where annealing targets making the steel as soft as possible, tempering is done with a target hardness in mind.

3. The dataset I'll be working with is from kaggle and has about 1500 rows. It was provided to the public by the company Raiipa, an metalurgical engineering firm focus on AI applications. The data is pulled from 3 scientific reviews, dating from 1945 to 2010. I chose to use this dataset to build an engineering tool that would allow the prediction of the tempering conditions, temperature and time, to reach a target hardness.
