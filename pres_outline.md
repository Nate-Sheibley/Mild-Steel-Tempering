# Presentation Reqs
## Clear Objective and Purpose
1. Goal-Oriented: Start with a clear understanding of the purpose of your presentation. What are you trying to convey? Is it to inform, persuade, or explore
data? Define your key message or insight.
2. Target Audience: Tailor your visualizations and explanations to the knowledge level and interests of your audience. Consider what they need to know and
how best to communicate that information to them.
## Relevant and Accurate Data
1. Relevant Data: for example, if your story is about hourly changes in rainfall, your visualization data shouldnâ€™t be in months.
2. Contextualization: if warranted, provide context for the data. Explain where it comes from, the time period it covers, and any assumptions or limitations.
## Effective Visual Design
1. Choosing the Right Chart Type: Use appropriate visualizations (bar charts, line graphs, scatter plots, etc.) that best represent the data and the insights you
want to convey.
2. Simplicity: Avoid clutter and unnecessary details. Strive for simplicity in design while ensuring all necessary information is included.
3. Consistency: Maintain consistent use of colors, fonts, and design elements throughout the presentation to avoid confusion and enhance readability.
4. Accessibility [OPTIONAL]: Ensure that the design is accessible to all viewers, including those with color blindness or other visual impairments. Use color
palettes that are colorblind-friendly and provide sufficient contrast.
